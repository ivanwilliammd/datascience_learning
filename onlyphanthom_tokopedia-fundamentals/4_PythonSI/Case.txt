Case :
Students can formulate a hypothesis testing from the example taught.

-----------Hypothesis testing------------

1. Using "tokped_hp.csv" data. Based on the data, we want to find out whether
the average price of mobile phones with Apple's trademark on Batam has a 
significant difference in the price of mobile phones with Apple's trademark
in all locations.

2. [Exercise] Based on the data "tokped_hp.csv" the student is asked to make 
a hypothesis regarding the average price of mobile phones with the Samsung 
trademark on Batam has a significant difference in the price of mobile phones
with trademarks the same in all locations.


-------Z-score-------

1. For example, from all cellphone sellers on an e-commerce has average
sales of 80 transactions per day with a standard deviation for 5 transactions. 
From the transaction if the average transaction is done by sellers of more 
than 80 transactions per day or not far away significant than 80 transactions 
will get a reward in the form of a "trusted seller".
Let say there is one company named "Elektrosell" that has 32 branch office
which sells celphone. They have average sales per day about 74 transactions 
per day, whether the "Elektrosell" will get a reward?

From the case, we can formulate what is the average sales
from "Elektrosell" differed statistically significantly from the mean
mobile phone sales from the population?
